# Definition: git status
The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. <br/>
You can access the same information in JupyterLab IDE by clicking git icon on the left-hand side of JupyterLab IDE and then clicking the Changes tab.
